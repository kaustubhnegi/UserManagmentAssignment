# UserManage

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Json-server

This project uses json-server as a server and api provider for CRUD operations

Install JSON Server 

```
npm install -g json-server
```

Create a `db.json` file with some data

```json
{
  "posts": [
    { "id": 1, "title": "json-server", "author": "typicode" }
  ],
  "comments": [
    { "id": 1, "body": "some comment", "postId": 1 }
  ],
  "profile": { "name": "typicode" }
}
```

Start JSON Server

```bash
json-server --watch db.json
```

Now if you go to [http://localhost:3000/user/1](http://localhost:3000/user/1), you'll get

```json
{ "id": 1, "title": "json-server", "author": "typicode" }
```

Also when doing requests, it's good to know that:

- If you make POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE requests, changes will be automatically and safely saved to `db.json` using [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb).
- Your request body JSON should be object enclosed, just like the GET output. (for example `{"name": "Foobar"}`)
- Id values are not mutable. Any `id` value in the body of your PUT or PATCH request will be ignored. Only a value set in a POST request will be respected, but only if not already taken.
- A POST, PUT or PATCH request should include a `Content-Type: application/json` header to use the JSON in the request body. Otherwise it will return a 2XX status code, but without changes being made to the data. 

## Routes

Based on the previous `db.json` file, here are all the default routes. You can also add [other routes](#add-custom-routes) using `--routes`.

## Plural routes

```
GET    /posts
GET    /posts/1
POST   /posts
PUT    /posts/1
PATCH  /posts/1
DELETE /posts/1
```

### Singular routes

```
GET    /profile
POST   /profile
PUT    /profile
PATCH  /profile
```

### Filter

Use `.` to access deep properties

```
GET /posts?title=json-server&author=typicode
GET /posts?id=1&id=2
GET /comments?author.name=typicode
```
